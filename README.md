Mark is fan of logic based games. However he is bored of the basic ones, like Sudoku and Mastermind, since he has solved so many of them. Recently he found a new game in which one is given a string with some question marks in it. The objective is to replace all of the question marks with letters(one letter per question mark) in such a way that no letters appears next to another letter of the same kind.

Write a function that given a string puzzle, returns a copy of the string with all the question marks replaced by lowercase letters(a-z) in such a way that the same letters do not occur next to each other. The result can be any of the possible answers as long as it fulfils the above requirements.

Examples:

Given puzzle = 'xy?xz?', your function might return 'xycxza'. Some other possible results are 'xyzxzd', 'xyfxzf'.

Given puzzle = 'ab?e?mr??'. Your function might return 'abveamrab'

Given puzzle = '??????'. Your function might return 'league'

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

String puzzle contains only of lowercase letters(a-z) or '?'
It is always possible to turn string 'puzzle' into a string without two identical consecutive letters
